waf
---

Ardour uses WAF (https://waf.io/) as the build-system.
WAF build-scripts are distributed as shell-scripts with an
embedded tarball (containing python sources).
In Debian, these binary blobs are removed, and instead a verbatim copy
of WAF can be found in debian/waf/

Importing WAF (into the debian/ folder) is done manually, with the
debian/get-waf.sh script.

git-tuneclone.sh
----------------

This package comes with a script 'debian/git-tuneclone.sh'.
Running it after a fresh clone of the packaging repository
will fine-tune your local copy, namely:
- make git ignore any .pc/ directory (created by quilt)
- enable the "-follow-tags" when running 'git-push', so it's harder
  to forget to push packaging tags along with the branches.
- do an initial checkout of the 3 packaging branches (master, pristine-tar,
  upstream)
The script only needs to run once (though running it multiple times shouldn't
matter).
You are of course free to *not* run the script, if you prefer.
